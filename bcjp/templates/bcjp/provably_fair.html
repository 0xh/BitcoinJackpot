                    <dd>The round hash is an md5 string that is given at the beginning of each round. The hash is generated by concatinating the round winner percentage and the round secret and then applying a md5 encryption on the following string "[ROUND SECRET]-[ROUND WINNER PERCENTAGE]".</dd>
                    <dt>Round Secret</dt>
                    <dd>The round secret is generated at the beginning of each round but is only displayed at the end of each round. The round secret, along with the round winner percentage, is used to generate the round hash. The round secret is a 48 character alphanumeric string.</dd>
                    <dt>Round Winner Percentage</dt>
                    <dd>The round winner percentage is used to determine the round winner. To get the winning ticket number the following formula can be applied <strong>floor(TotalTickets - 0.0001) * (RoundWinnerPercentage / 100))</strong>. After receiving the winner ticket number finding the winning ticket is as simple as counting the number of tickets (1 ticket per 0.0001<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-btc" aria-hidden="true"></span>) starting from bet 1 towards bet 25.</dd>
